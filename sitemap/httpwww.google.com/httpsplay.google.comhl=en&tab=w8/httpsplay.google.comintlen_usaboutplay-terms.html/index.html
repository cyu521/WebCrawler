  <h1> Google Play Terms of Service </h1> 
  <p> December 9, 2015 </p> 
  <h2> 1. Introduction </h2> 
  <p> <strong>Applicable Terms.</strong> Thanks for using Google Play. Google Play is a service provided by Google Inc. (<strong>“Google”</strong>, <strong>“we”</strong> or <strong>“us”</strong>), located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View California 94043, USA, and is subject to the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/">Google Terms of Service</a> (<strong>"Google ToS"</strong>). Google Play is a <strong>“Service”</strong> as defined in the Google ToS, and these Google Play Terms of Service are additional terms which apply to the use of Google Play. Your use of Google Play and the digital content available on it is subject to these Google Play Terms of Service and the Google ToS (which together we refer to as the <strong>“Terms”</strong>). </p> 
  <p> If there is any conflict between the Google Play Terms of Service and the Google ToS, the Google Play Terms of Service shall prevail. </p> 
  <p> Your use of the Google Play store requires that you agree to the following terms. Please read them carefully. If you do not understand the Terms, or do not accept any part of them, then you should not use the Google Play store. Some products and features may be not available in all countries. Please see the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/?hl=en#topic=3364260">Google Play Help Center</a> for more information. </p> 
  <h2> 2. Provision of Google Play </h2> 
  <p> <strong>Direct, Agency and App Sales</strong>. When you buy “<strong>Content</strong>” (defined as data files, applications, written text, mobile device software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) on Google Play you will buy it either: </p> 
  <p> (a) directly from Google (a <strong>“Direct Sale”</strong>); </p> 
  <p> (b) from the provider of the Content (the <strong>“Provider”</strong>), where Google is acting as an agent for the Provider (an <strong>“Agency Sale”</strong>); or </p> 
  <p> (c) in the case of Android apps, from the Provider of the app (an <strong>“App Sale”</strong>). </p> 
  <p> Each time that you purchase Content, you enter into a separate sale contract: </p> 
  <p> (d) based on the Terms (as applicable) with Google (in the case of a Direct Sale); </p> 
  <p> (e) based on the Terms (as applicable) with the Provider of the Content you have purchased (in the case of Agency Sales); or </p> 
  <p> (f) with the Provider of the Content you have purchased (in the case of App Sales). </p> 
  <p> The separate sale contract in (e) or (f) above (as applicable) is in addition to your contract with Google Inc. for the use of the Service (i.e. these Google Play Terms of Service). </p> 
  <p> For Agency Sales the statement, in the Google ToS, that the Google ToS “do not create any third party beneficiary rights”, does not apply to your use of the Service. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Access to Content.</strong> You may use Google Play to browse, locate, and/or download Content) for your mobile, computer or other supported device (<strong>“Device”</strong>). The availability of Content will vary between countries and not all Content may be available in your country. Some of this Content may be offered by Google while others may be made available by third-parties not affiliated with Google. Google is not responsible for any Content on Google Play that originates from a source other than Google and does not endorse such content. </p> 
  <h2> 3. Your Use of Google Play </h2>

If you are 13 or older but under 18 years of age, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use Google Play and to accept the Terms. In order to serve as the family manager of a family group on Google Play, you must be at least 18 years old. You must not access Google Play if you are a person who is either barred or otherwise legally prohibited from receiving or using the Service or any Content under the laws of the country in which you are resident or from which you access or use Google Play. You must comply with any additional age restrictions that might apply for the use of specific Content on Google Play. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Basic Use Requirements.</strong> To use the Service, you will need a Device that meets the system and compatibility requirements for the relevant Content, which may change from time to time, working Internet access, and compatible software. Your ability to use the Service and the performance of the Service may be affected by these factors. Such system requirements are your responsibility. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Third-Party Fees.</strong> You may incur access or data fees from third parties (such as your Internet provider or mobile carrier) in connection with your use of Content and Google Play. For instance, you may incur such fees if you use services provided through Google Play on or through third-party services or devices. You are responsible for all such fees. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Updates.</strong> You may need to install updates to Google Play or related Google software that we introduce from time to time to use Google Play and to access or download Content. Content originating from Google may communicate with Google servers from time to time to check for available updates to the Content and to the functionality of Google Play, such as bug fixes, patches, enhanced functions, missing plug-ins and new versions (collectively, <strong>"Updates"</strong>). Your use of the Content you have installed requires that you have agreed to receive such automatically requested Updates. If you do not agree to such automatically requested and received Updates then please do not use the Google Play store or install this Content. </p> 
  <p> Google may update any Google app or any app you have downloaded from Google Play to a new version of such app, irrespective of any update settings that you may have selected within the Google Play app or your Device, if Google determines that the update will fix a critical security vulnerability related to the app. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Information about You.</strong> In order to access certain services or Content on Google Play, you may be required to provide information about yourself such as your name, address, and billing details. The information we collect, including information obtained from third parties, is shared between Google and its group companies to operate the Service. Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">privacy policies</a> explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when using Google Play. Any such information you provide to Google must always be accurate, correct and up to date. Google may need to provide your personal information, such as your name and email address, to Providers for the purposes of processing your transactions and/or provisioning Content to you. Google has agreed with Providers that they will use this information in accordance with their privacy policies. </p> 
  <p> If you are part of a family group on Google Play, your family members in the family group will be able to see certain information about you. If you are the family manager of a family group on Google Play, family members you invite to join the family group will see your name, photo, and e-mail address. If you join a family group as a family member, other family members will be able to see your name, photo, and e-mail address, and if you purchase Content using a family payment method, your family manager will see a record of every purchase you make, including a description of the Content. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Unauthorised Access to Accounts.</strong> You must keep your user details secure and must not share them with anyone else. You must not collect or harvest any personal data of any user of Google Play or of any user of other Google Services via Google Play, including account names. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Disabled Accounts.</strong> If Google disables access to your account in accordance with the Terms (for example if you violate the Terms), you may be prevented from accessing Google Play, your account details or any files or other Content that is stored with your account. If you are the family manager of a family on Google Play and Google disables access to your account, your family members may lose access to family features requiring a family group, such as a family payment method or family subscriptions. Please see section 6 below for your rights where you are not able to download Content before your account is disabled. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Malware protection.</strong> To protect you against malicious third party software and other security issues, Google may receive information about your device’s network connections, the operating system, and third party apps. Google may warn you if it considers an app to be unsafe, or remove or block its installation on your Device if it is known to be harmful to devices, data or users. You can choose to disable these protections in the Google Settings on your Device (however, apps installed through the Store may continue to be analyzed for security issues). </p> 
  <h2> 4. Purchases and Payments </h2> 
  <p> <strong>Free Content.</strong> Google may allow you to download or use Content free of charge. Any terms and conditions that apply to purchased Content will apply to free Content, except with respect to payment-related matters (for example, the refund-related provisions of these terms do not apply to such free Content). Google may impose limitations on your access and use of certain free Content. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Purchase of Content.</strong> Your contract for the purchase and use of Content is completed once you receive the email from Google confirming your purchase of that Content, and performance of this contract begins as soon as the purchase is complete. If you are the family manager of a family group on Google Play, you will be required to set up a valid family payment method for your family members to use to purchase Content on Google Play and within apps. You will be responsible for all of your family members’ purchases of Content using the family payment method. If a family group is deleted, or a family member leaves the family group, you may be charged for pending purchases made by family members using the family payment method. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Google Payments.</strong> In order to purchase Content on Google Play, you must agree to the payment terms as specified in the Google Payments <a href="//payments.google.com/customer/tos/viewdocument.html?family=0.buyertos&amp;gl=us">Terms of Service</a>. If you do not have a Google Payment account, you can set one up by going to <a href="https://payments.google.com/">this link</a>, where you can also find more information about Google Payments. The Payments Terms of Service and <a href="https://wallet.google.com/files/privacy.html?hl=en">Privacy Notice</a> also apply whenever you want to purchase Content using a Google Payments account. Please ensure that you read those terms carefully before making any purchase. Some purchases in Google Play will require you to transact with the product Provider directly. In these cases, to process your transaction and maintain your account, we may share your personal information with the product Provider, as permitted under the Payments Privacy Notice. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Other Payment Processing Methods.</strong> Google may make available to you various payment processing methods in addition to Google Payments account to facilitate the purchase of Content on Google Play. You must abide by any relevant terms and conditions or other legal agreement, whether with Google or a third party, that governs your use of a given payment processing method. Google may add or remove payment processing methods at its sole discretion and without notice to you. Once your purchase is complete, Google or Google’s payment processor may charge your credit card or other form of payment that you indicate for any Content ordered, along with any additional applicable amounts (including any taxes). You are solely responsible for all amounts payable associated with purchases you make on Google Play. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Eligibility for Carrier Billing.</strong> In order to determine your eligibility to have purchases of Content that you make through your mobile Devices billed to your mobile network provider’s account, when you create a Google Play account on a Device we will send identifiers of your Device, subscriber ID and SIM card serial number to your network provider. To permit this you will need to accept the network provider’s terms of service. The network provider may send us your billing address information to help us create your Google Play account. We will hold and use this information in accordance with Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">Privacy Policies</a>. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Pricing.</strong> Pricing and availability of all Content displayed on Google Play are subject to change at any time before you click the button indicating that you want to purchase Content. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Taxes.</strong> You are responsible for any Taxes, and must pay for Content without any reduction for Taxes. If the seller of Content is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be charged to you.<strong>"Taxes"</strong> means any duties, customs fees, or taxes (other than income tax) associated with the sale of Content, including any related penalties or interest. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Compliance with Tax Laws.</strong> You must comply with any and all applicable tax laws, including the reporting and payment of any taxes arising in connection with your use of Google Play or the purchase of Content through Google Play. The reporting and payment of any such applicable taxes are your responsibility. </p> 
  <p> <strong>All Sales Final.</strong> Except as expressly set out in the Terms or Google’s refund policies displayed in the Service, all sales are final, and no returns, replacements or refunds are permitted. If a replacement, return or refund is granted for any transaction, the transaction may be reversed, and you may no longer be able to access the Content that you acquired through that transaction. Your rights to withdraw, cancel or return purchases and get a refund are set out in the additional terms for the relevant Content type set out below and the refund policies displayed in the Service. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Pre-orders.</strong> </p> 
  <p> (a) When you place a pre-order for a Product, your contract for the purchase and use of that item is completed when the Product becomes available in your account and you will be charged for the purchase at that time. You can cancel your pre-order at any time up to the point at which the Product becomes available to you (if you want to cancel the pre-order you will be able to do so by visiting the “My Orders” page and following the instructions there). </p> 
  <p> (b) After the moment when the Product becomes available to you, you will not able to withdraw or cancel the pre-order and your cancellation and return rights are the same as for other Products that you purchase through Google Play. Please see the terms below for more information. </p> 
  <p> (c) We will need to cancel your pre-order if the Product is withdrawn from sale in the store before it is made available and we reserve the right to cancel your order in the event the price changes before your order is fulfilled. </p> 
  <h2> 5. Subscriptions </h2> 
  <p> <strong>Trials of Magazines News Content and Music.</strong> Subscribing to a free trial for a magazine or new content on Google Play Newsstand or for music (including as part of your purchase of a subscription for a magazine or music) gives you access to the subscription benefits for that magazine for free for a specified trial period. At the end of such trial period, you will be charged the price of the first period of the subscription and will continue to be charged until you cancel your subscription. <strong>To avoid being charged, you must cancel before the end of the trial period.</strong> If you cancel during the trial period you will retain access to the magazine issues that you access during a free trial period, but you will not retain access to news content or Music Subscription Content (as defined below) that you access during a free trial period unless you become a paid subscriber. Access to free trials may be limited to a certain number of free trials for each user during a given period. To avoid any charges, you must cancel before the end of the trial period; for more information on cancelling subscriptions, see the section titled ”Cancellations” below in this section 5. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Trials of Apps.</strong> Subscribing to a trial for an Android app gives you access to the subscription benefits for that app for free for a duration specified by the application developer. At the end of the trial period, you will be charged the price of the first period of the subscription and will continue to be charged until you cancel your subscription. <strong>To avoid being charged, you must cancel before the end of the trial period.</strong> Once you cancel your trial, you will immediately lose access to the relevant app and any subscription privileges. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Cancellations.</strong> If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription (whether monthly, annual or another period) to Content, you may cancel that subscription at any time before the end of the applicable billing cycle, and the cancellation will apply to the next period. For example, if you purchase a monthly subscription, you may cancel that subscription at any time during any month of the subscription, and the subscription will be cancelled as of the following month. You will not receive a refund for the current billing period, except in the event of a defective product (as set out in section 6 below), or as otherwise set out out in these Terms. With respect to magazine or news content subscriptions on Google Play Newsstand, you will continue to receive Content and updates (if applicable) of the relevant subscription during the remainder of the current billing period. After that billing period ends, your access to previously delivered magazine issues will not be affected by the cancellation, but your access to paid news content will terminate at the end of the billing period during which your subscription is cancelled. With respect to music subscriptions, you will continue to have access to Music Subscription Content (as defined in Section 7 below) during the remainder of the current billing period; however, your access to Music Subscription Content will terminate at the end of the billing period during which your subscription is cancelled. Additional refund policies for music and periodicals are set out in sections 7 and 10 below, respectively. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Price Changes.</strong> When you purchase a subscription, you will initially be charged at the rate applicable at the time of your agreement to subscribe. If the price of the subscription increases later, Google will notify you. The increase will apply to the next payment due from you after the notice, provided that you have been given at least 10 days' prior notice before the charge is made. If you are given less than 10 days' prior notice, the price increase will not apply until the payment after the next payment due. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Declining Price Changes.</strong> If you do not wish to pay the increased price for a subscription, you may cancel the subscription in the manner described in the Google Play <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/?hl=en">help center</a> and you will not be charged further amounts for the subscription, provided you have notified us before the end of the current billing period. In some cases where the Provider increases the price of a subscription Google may cancel your subscription unless you agree to re-subscribe at the new price. If your subscription is cancelled and you later decide to re-subscribe, you will initially be charged at the then current subscription rate. </p> 
  <h2> 6. Rights and Restrictions </h2> 
  <p> <strong>License to Use Content.</strong> Following payment of the applicable fees for Content, you will have the non-exclusive right, for the period selected by you in the case of a purchase for a rental period, and in other cases for as long as Google and the applicable copyright holder have rights to provide you that Content, to download or stream, in each case, solely as expressly permitted by Google via the Google Play user interface and subject to the restrictions set out in the Terms and associated policies, copies of the applicable Content to your Devices, and to view, use, and display the Content on your Devices or as otherwise authorized by Google as part of the Service for your personal, non-commercial use only.

  <p> <strong>Defective Content.</strong> Once Content is available to you through your account, you should check the Content as soon as reasonably possible to ensure that it downloads or streams correctly (as applicable) and performs as stated, and notify us as soon as reasonably possible if you find any errors or defect. In the case of Android apps, you should contact the developer concerning any defects or performance issues in the apps, as described in the Google Play <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/?hl=en">help center</a>. In the case of Content other than apps, subject to any limitations in the additional terms for the specific Content below, you may cancel purchases you have made from Google Play to Google if Google Play does not perform as stated with respect to that purchased Content, and Google will provide either a replacement Content (if available) or a refund of the purchase price. </p>

  <p> <strong>Removal or Unavailability of Content.</strong> Subject to the Terms, Content that you purchase will be available to you through Google Play for the period selected by you, in the case of a purchase for a rental period, and in other cases as long as Google has the right to make such content available to you. In certain cases (for example, if Google loses the relevant rights, discontinues a service or Content is discontinued, breaches applicable terms or the law), Google may remove from your Device or cease providing you with access to certain Content that you have purchased. Google will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any such removal or cessation. If you are not able to download a copy of the Content before such removal or cessation, then Google will offer you either (a) a replacement of the Content if possible or (b) a refund of the price of the Content. If Google issues you a refund, the refund of your purchase price shall be your sole remedy. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Effect of Refunds.</strong> If a refund of the purchase price of Content for any reason is issued to you, you will no longer have the right to access the relevant Content. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Select, Copy and Paste.</strong> Select, copy and paste functions may be available for some text-based Content, and you must use these features within the prescribed limits and only for personal non-commercial purposes. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Multiple Accounts.</strong> If you have multiple Google accounts with different user names, in some cases you may transfer Content out of an account and into another account, provided you are the owner of each such account and provided Google has enabled a feature of the relevant service allowing such transfers. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Limits on access on Devices.</strong> Google may from time to time place limits on the number of Devices and/or software applications you may use to access Content (for more information, please visit the Help link for the relevant Content within Google Play). Google may record and store the unique device identifier numbers of your Devices in order to enforce such limits. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Dangerous Activities.</strong> None of the Services or Content are intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, life support systems, emergency communications, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or any other such activities in which case the failure of the Services or Content could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Changes to these Terms.</strong> </p> 
  <p> If the Terms change, you will be asked to accept new terms before you next purchase Content. Once you have accepted the new terms, they will apply to your use of all Content (including Content you have purchased in the past) and all subsequent purchases, until we notify you of further changes. </p> 
  <p> If you refuse to accept the updated terms then you will not be able to buy any further Content through Google Play, and the latest version of the Terms that you accepted will continue to apply to your use of Content. In this case we will, if we are able to do so, give you a reasonable period of time in which to download a copy of any Content you have previously bought from Google Play to your Device, and you may continue to view that copy of the Content on your Devices in accordance with the last version of the Terms that you accepted. </p> 
  <p> After that time has expired, you will not be given a further opportunity to download the Content you have previously bought and it is possible that you will no longer be able to use Google Play to access or use the Content you have already bought or related support services. If this happens, Google will offer you either a replacement of the Content, or a refund of the price of the Content, which will be your sole remedy. To access or use the Content you have already bought or related support services, you may also need to create a new account. </p> 
  <h2> 7. Music on Google Play </h2> 
  <p> <strong>Introduction.</strong> Google Play includes certain music-related products and services, which are described in greater detail below and defined as <strong>“Music Products”</strong>, <strong>“Music Subscription Content”</strong>and <strong>“Music Locker Services”</strong>. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Music Products; Music Subscription Content.</strong> The Google Play store allows you to browse, preview, stream, purchase, download, recommend and use a variety of digital music and music-related content such as music files, music video files, previews, clips, artist information, user reviews, professional third-party music reviews and other digital content (<strong>“Music Products”</strong>). Certain Music Products may be accessible to you by purchasing (or receiving a free trial of) a subscription to a music subscription service made available via Google Play (<strong>“Music Subscription Content”</strong>). Music Products may be owned by Google or its third-party partners and licensors and may contain watermarks or other embedded data. For clarity, all Music Products constitute “Products” as defined in Section 1 above. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Stored Content.</strong> You can use Google Play to store digital content (such as music files, related metadata and album art) in Music Storage through the Music Software, as each is defined below (<strong>“Stored Content”</strong>). For the avoidance of doubt, “Music Products” do not include Stored Content. Stored Content may include both files that you upload directly to Music Storage and/or files that Google “scans and matches” to files stored locally on your Device. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Music Locker Services.</strong> Google Play may provide you with access to (a) server space that you can use to store music and associated data files, including Music Products and Stored Content (<strong>“Music Storage”</strong>) and/or (b) software applications (including web, desktop and mobile applications) and related services that allow you to upload, manage, access and play music through Music Storage (<strong>"Music Software"</strong>). Music Storage and Music Software are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “<strong>Music Locker Service</strong>”. For clarity, you may be given access to Stored Content and Music Subscription Content through the same user interface. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Use of Music Locker Services.</strong> By storing Music Products and Stored Content in Music Storage, you are storing a unique copy of such content and requesting Google to retain it on your behalf and to make it accessible to you through your Google account. By using the Music Locker Services, you are requesting that Google make all of the necessary functions and features of the Music Locker Services available to you in order to facilitate your use of Music Products and Stored Content. Additionally, by accessing or using Music Products and Stored Content through the Music Software, you are initiating and performing the corresponding functions on Google's servers, together with any related steps necessary to achieve them, through the Music Locker Services. You understand that Google, in performing the required technical steps at your direction to provide you with the Music Locker Services, may (a) transmit Music Products and Stored Content over various networks and in various media and (b) make such changes to Music Products and Stored Content as are necessary to conform and adapt it to the technical requirements of connecting networks, devices, services or media. You confirm and warrant to Google that you have the necessary rights to store in Music Storage any Stored Content that you direct Google to upload or store in Music Storage, and to instruct Google to perform the actions described in this section. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Cancelling a Music Purchase; Refunds.</strong> You have the right to cancel each purchase of a Music Product from Google (including a music subscription) for a refund within 7 working days of the day after that Music Product becomes available for you to download or stream, provided that, with respect to music subscription free trials: (i) you may cancel your subscription at any time during a free trial period (as set out in section 5 above) and (ii) you will not have the foregoing 7-day cancellation right once the paid portion of your subscription has commenced. Once you download or stream any Music Product that you purchase, you no longer have the right to cancel your purchase of that Music Product (unless the Music Product is defective). If Google grants to you a refund for a music subscription, the refund amount will be pro-rated to reflect remaining term of the subscription. Following Google’s provision of a refund to you, you will no longer have the right to access the applicable Music Product. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Other Google Subscription Services.</strong> You may receive access to a Google Play music subscription as part of a subscription to another Google product; additionally, you may receive access to other Google subscription products as part of a Google Play music subscription. The details of your access to such other Google subscription products will be presented to you before you complete your music subscription purchase. Your use of Google Play and any Google Play music subscription product is governed solely by these Terms, and not the terms of any other Google product, including any other Google product through which you receive access to a Google Play music subscription. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Social Recommendations</strong>. When you purchase Music Products, you may be given the opportunity to share all or a portion of the Music Products to your profile on Google+ or other Google-approved social networks or online destinations, as determined by Google in its sole discretion (<strong>"Social Recommendation"</strong>). Your use of Social Recommendations shall be subject to the Terms and any other terms and conditions applicable to the social networks or online destinations to which you share such Social Recommendations. Google may impose limitations on your Social Recommendations. For example, Google may render the Music Product associated with any Social Recommendation as a limited-length preview rather than a full-length play. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Rights to Stored Content.</strong> You retain any rights that you already hold in Stored Content. For the avoidance of doubt, Stored Content is not subject to the license grant to Google in the section of the Google Terms of Service titled “Your Content in our Services.” </p>
